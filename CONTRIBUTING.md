# Contributing to drel

Thanks for your interest in improving drel! This document covers how to build,
test, and submit changes.

drel is pre-1.0 — the API may still change between minor versions. Bug reports,
real-world usage feedback, and focused PRs are all very welcome.

## Prerequisites

- Go (see the version in [`go.mod`](go.mod)).
- Docker — required only for the integration test suites (they use
  [testcontainers](https://golang.testcontainers.org/) to spin up Postgres and
  libSQL).

## Building

```bash
go build ./...                 # core + CLI (default: Postgres + SQLite)
go build -tags libsql ./...    # also compile the LibSQL/Turso driver
go vet ./...
gofmt -l .                     # should print nothing
```

The CLI lives in `./cmd/drel`.

## Testing

```bash
# Fast unit + SQLite tests (no Docker needed)
go test ./...
go test -race ./...

# Postgres integration suite (needs Docker)
go test -tags integration ./...

# LibSQL/Turso round-trip against a real libsql-server (needs Docker)
go test -tags 'integration libsql' -run TestIntegration_LibSQL ./...

# Benchmarks (needs Docker)
go test -tags integration -bench . -benchmem .
```

Integration tests are gated behind the `integration` build tag and the LibSQL
test additionally behind `libsql`, so the default `go test ./...` stays fast and
Docker-free. **Please add tests for new query paths** — several real bugs (e.g.
int64/int mismatches) only surface against a real database.

## Code generation

drel generates per-model code and an aggregated `DB` struct. After changing the
emitter (`internal/codegen`), regenerate every example so they don't drift:

```bash
for d in examples/*/; do
  [ -f "$d/drel.yaml" ] && (cd "$d" && go run ../../cmd/drel generate)
done
```

Generated files (`*_drel.go`, `db/drel_gen.go`) are gofmt-formatted by the
emitter and committed to the repo.

## Commits & pull requests

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`,
  `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `refactor:`. The release changelog is
  generated from commit subjects.
- Keep PRs focused; include tests and update docs (README / `docs/prd.md`) when
  behavior or public API changes.
- Before opening a PR, make sure `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`,
  `gofmt -l .` (empty), and `go test ./...` all pass. CI runs these plus the
  integration suites.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with a minimal reproduction (model definition + the query/SaveChanges
that misbehaves), the dialect, and the drel version. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for security-sensitive reports.
